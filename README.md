# WordGuess-Cli

### Overview
This is an execution of the Word Guess/Hangman Game using Command Line Interface (CLI) only.  The purpose is to provide a simple Word Guess/Hangman Game to pass the time during the Coronavirus quarantine period, or any self-imposed or non-self-imposed quarantine period.   Additionally, the project has afforded this programmer the opportunity to develop skills with CLI NPM package [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), as well as develop programming skills in use of JS constructors, objects and methods.  `Enjoy`.
